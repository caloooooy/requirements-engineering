							<h4>4 Major Phases of Requirements Engineering</h4>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<div class="fragment" >
							<h4>1. Requirements Elicitation</h4>
						</div>
						<hr class="fragment">
						<p class="fragment" >
							&#x21FE; Is the practice of researching and discovering the requirements of a system 
							from users, customers, and other stakeholders.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
							<div class="fragment">
								<h4>2. Requirements Analysis</h4>
							</div>
							<hr class="fragment">
							<p class="fragment">
								&#x21FE; Focuses on the tasks that determine the needs or conditions
								to meet the new or altered product or project, taking account of the possibly conflicting
								requirements of the various stakeholders, analyzing, documenting, validating and managing
								software or system requirements.
							</p>
					</section>
					<section>
							<div class="fragment">
								<h4>3. Requirements Documentation</h4>
							</div>
							<hr class="fragment">
							<p class="fragment">
								&#x21FE; In project management describes how each requirement meets the
								business needs for the project. Requirements should be measurable, traceable, consistent,
								complete and acceptable to the stakeholders.
							</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<div class="fragment" >
							<h4>4. Requirements Verification & Validation</h4>
						</div>
						<hr class="fragment">
						<p class="fragment">
							&#x21FE; Are independent procedures that are used together for checking
							that a product, service, or system meets requirements and specifications and that it fulfills
							its intended purpose.

						<h4>Challenges on Requirement Engineering</h4>
					</section>
					<section>
						1. Incomplete or hidden Requirements
						2. Inconsistent Requirements
						3. Terminology:
						4. Unclear responsibilities
						5. Communication
						6. Moving targets
						7. Technically unfeasible Requirements
						8. Stake Holders don't know requirements from previous solutions
						9. Underspecified Requirements
						10. Unclear or Unmeasurable non-functional Requirements	
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Incomplete or Hidden Requirements</h4>
						<hr>
						- didnt ask enough questions or they didnt remember to tell us everything
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Inconsistent Requirements</h4>
						<hr>
						- when 1 reqs states something that contradicts another reqs in your set and you can't posibly 
							satisfy both at the same time
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Terminology</h4>
						<hr>
						- once you are out in the wild doing RE, you gon be as insistent as her in termnology
						- doesn't mean people use the same term doesn't mean they say the same thing when they talk 
						about it
						- best ex: throw a bunch of SE in a room and ask them what is a system?
						you'll get 25 different ansers and be surprise with how different understandings pips can have 
						on the same term
						- so unless you take time and talk about what are the most important terms for the system. you 
						may run into trouble.
						-  as a SE like sir. Markus you may end up working in a domain that you are not very familiar 
						with
						- you will have to be familiar with their terminology
						- so it's important to time in to learn the domain yourself or to have access to domain expert 
						to stakeholder of that company who will explain all the necessary terminology to you 
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Unclear Responsibilities</h4>
						<hr>
						- means it is not clear who has the say, 
						- who's allowed to state reqs, 
						- not clear which stakeholders are the most important ones to interview
						- and that can later on lead into trouble, when you find out oh there another bunch of poips i 
							need to talk to becsau i didn't coz i ddindt know
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Communication</h4>
						<hr>
						- along with num4 we often have communication problems
						- that can be the structure of com
						- chain of responsibility thing
						- short emails 
						- diff culture same terms but diff things
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Moving Targets</h4>
						<hr>
						- customer change their opinion about what they wanted
						- like last week they need these 3 features but the other one isn't that importatn anymore and 
						just want the other two. then you say sure, did it then they changed their mind again
						- the problem is you are not moving forward in development and eventually you'll be runin over 
						budget and overtime
						- your clients may always change their mind at some point
						- that's why you need to make sure they sign off on the base line req after a specified 
						period of time and that its clear when they need to pay additional charges or when pay for an 
						extra feature to avoid the cost of moving targets
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Technically Unfeasible Requirements</h4>
						<hr>
						- to deal with those make sure on every domain you are touching you have one domain 
						expert on your team 
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Stake Holders don't know Requirements from previous solutions</h4>
						<hr>
						- they are not experts on the domain of software systems development at least they are not 
						usually
						- they dont necessarily knokw how to separate between what they knew as a previous solution and 
						what is it they actually need 
						- they doesn't know what they want until you show it to them
						- like when filing a documents every single day having a machine do it for you digitally will be 
						so much improvements
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Underspecified Requirements</h4>
						<hr>
						- ex: you can only delete a post when logged in. after logging in the user tries to 
						create a post he couldn't because it was said that you can only "delete when logged in" 
						didn't specify that user can do several things when loged in

					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Unclear or Unmeasurable non-functional Requirements	</h4>
						<hr>
						- many of those specify certain characteristics of the system
						- if the reqs is system should be fast.. but we have no Idea what fast means to that client
						- could mean db response in 3 sec if not that important
						- but 3 sec could cause you a 3mill usd when system is on the stock market
						- you want your non-functional reqs be very clearly measurable
